Global climate change affects flows, which is crucial for policymaking in agriculture, hydropower generation, and conservation of natural habitats. The aim of this paper is to discover the spatial and temporal characteristics of flows in Scotland and to develop effective predictive models. Based on data from 65 stations between 1989 to 2015, this paper develops generalised additive models (GAMs) with temporal, seasonal, and spatial as explanatory variables and catchment area and maximum elevation as covariates, and selects the best model through AIC and BIC criteria, tests significance through hypothesis testing, and tests the effectiveness of prediction by k-fold cross-validation. The results reveal that Scottish flows show a clear upward trend and a seasonal effect of smaller summer flows and larger winter flows. Spatially flows are smaller at higher altitudes than at lower ones, and flows are less on the west coast than on the east coast. The study predicts a continued increase in average flows in Scotland from 2021 to 2030.
